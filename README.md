## Overview

`dnadesign` is a collection of modular bioinformatic pipelines and helper packages related to biological sequence design.

## Documentation

- Canonical docs navigation lives in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).
- Use that index for operator docs (BU SCC, Notify) and workflow guidance.

## Available tools

- [**usr**](src/dnadesign/usr) (Universal Sequence Record)

      Consists of utility commands to inspect datasets/Parquet files used across the `dnadesign` project.

- [**notify**](src/dnadesign/notify)

      Tool-agnostic webhook notifier for batch runs (Slack/Discord/generic webhooks).

- [**densegen**](src/dnadesign/densegen)

      DNA sequence design pipeline built on the integer linear programming framework from the [`dense-arrays`](https://github.com/e-south/dense-arrays) package.

- [**infer**](src/dnadesign/infer)

      Model-agnostic wrapper for DNA/protein language models (e.g., [Evo2](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2/tree/main)).

- [**opal**](src/dnadesign/opal)

      An [EVOLVEpro-style](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr6006) active-learning tool for DNA/protein sequence design campaigns.

- [**cluster**](src/dnadesign/cluster)

      A Parquet/CSV-first tool for Leiden clustering, UMAP visualisation, and a mix of other analyses.

- [**billboard**](src/dnadesign)

      Quantifies the regulatory diversity of dense-array DNA libraries generated by **densegen**.

- [**libshuffle**](src/dnadesign/libshuffle)

      Iteratively subsamples sequence libraries from the sibling **sequences** directory and computes diversity metrics using the **billboard** pipeline as its engine.

- [**nmf**](src/dnadesign/nmf)

      Applies Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to a library of sequences generated by **densegen** to uncover higher-order transcription factor binding site combinations.

- [**latdna**](src/dnadesign/latdna)

      Pipeline for latent space analysis of DNA sequences.

- [**cruncher**](src/dnadesign/cruncher)

      Pipeline that scores TF position-weight matrices and uses parallel tempering MCMC to design short DNA sequences that score highly across one or more TFs.

- [**tfkdanalysis**](src/dnadesign/tfkdanalysis)

      Pipeline for analyzing transcription factor knockdown (TFKD) effects using PPTP-seq (Promoter responses to TF perturbation sequencing) data—a high-throughput approach described in [Han *et al.* (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41572-4).

- [**aligner**](src/dnadesign/aligner)

      Wrapper for Biopython's [PairwiseAligner](https://biopython.org/docs/dev/Tutorial/chapter_pairwise.html#chapter-pairwise), which is a class for computing Needleman–Wunsch global alignment scores between nucleotide sequences.

- [**permuter**](src/dnadesign/permuter)

      Pipeline for biological sequence permutation and subsequent evaluation workflows.
