## Eco1 RT Repack Status

**Owner:** dnadesign-maintainers
**Last verified:** 2026-06-23
**Status surface:** record-only

### Current Phase

Phase 1 has the required structure, source, alignment, conservation evidence,
manual mask authority, and mask set under
`outputs/thread/eco1_rt_conservative_v1/`. The selected mask rule is:

```text
eco1_rt_clade9_plurality25_direct_contact5a_v1
```

The rule is:

```text
protected =
  NAxxH / YADD / VTG
  OR Wang/Ec86 direct substrate-contact prior
  OR Eco1 amino acid is evolutionarily conserved at >=25% WT plurality in the Ec86 clade 9 MSA
  OR mapped residue is within 5 A of retained DNA/RNA

non_fixed = NOT protected
```

Terminal residues `1`, `2`, and `312-320` are not protected by this policy.
They are classified as `non_fixed_missing_backbone`: unprotected, but not
directly mutable by fixed-backbone ProteinMPNN until coordinates are supplied or
handled separately.

### Materialized Evidence

- Structure authority is `ec86kit_7v9u_protomer1`: PDB `7v9u`,
  RT chain `A`, retained DNA chain `D`, retained RNA chains `E/F`, paired
  protomer excluded, and no paired-protomer dimerization retention objective.
- `backbone_bundle.yaml` and `residue_map.parquet` are materialized. The
  selected fixed-backbone structure has 309 mapped positions and 11 missing
  terminal positions: `1`, `2`, `312-320`.
- `structure_preprocessing_manifest.yaml`, `contact_profile.parquet`, and
  `contact_geometry_profile.parquet` are materialized from the selected 7V9U /
  ec86kit protomer context.
- Mestre-derived source authority covers
  `ec86_clade9_conservation_v1` and
  `ec86_iia3_cluster42_1_conservation_v1`; the full Mestre roster remains
  context/candidate-pool evidence, not the conservation denominator.
- Provider source acquisition, source-record QC, source FASTA sufficiency,
  Clustal Omega alignments, and `conservation_profile.parquet` are available
  for both selected profiles.
- `conservation_profile.parquet` has 640 rows: 320 positions per selected
  profile. The mask rule uses `ec86_clade9_conservation_v1` as the
  conservation veto: Eco1 residues are protected when the Eco1 amino acid is
  the clade 9 plurality residue at frequency `>=25%`.
- Manual motif authority records NAxxH `105-109`, YADD `195-198`, and VTG
  `243-245` as protected anchors. RT1-RT7 intervals remain annotation/review
  labels and do not blanket hard-fix residues under this rule.
- Wang/Ec86 direct substrate-contact priors are protected when listed in
  `manual-mask-authority.yaml`.
- `mask_set.yaml` is materialized under
  `eco1_rt_clade9_plurality25_direct_contact5a_v1`; Phase 1 validates locally.

### Mask Counts

Applying the current rule gives this row classification:

| Class | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `non_fixed` mapped residues | 123 |
| `non_fixed_missing_backbone` terminal residues | 11 |
| evolutionarily conserved at >=25% WT plurality in the Ec86 clade 9 MSA | 106 |
| within 5 A retained DNA/RNA | 120 |
| NAxxH / YADD / VTG | 12 |
| Wang/Ec86 direct substrate-contact priors | 8 |

Total unprotected positions: `134`. Directly fixed-backbone ProteinMPNN mutable
positions from the current 7V9U backbone: `123`.

### Prior Mask Checks

`surface_accessibility_profile.parquet` and `contact_risk_profile.yaml` remain
evidence reviews. They do not protect or release residues under the current
mask.

The previous 20 A all-fixed mask is diagnostic history: it showed that broad
retained-nucleic-acid proximity fixes the whole RT and is therefore too blunt
for Eco1. The current `mask_set.yaml` uses the direct 5 A rule.

### Validator Commands

Phase 0 scaffold validation:

```bash
uv run python -m dnadesign.studies.units.eco1_rt_repack.operations.contract_validation --repo-root . --phase phase0_scaffold
```

Phase 1 contract validation:

```bash
uv run python -m dnadesign.studies.units.eco1_rt_repack.operations.contract_validation --repo-root . --phase phase1_thread_contract
```

### Current Next Actions

1. Generate a small explicit sampling plan with backend, seed, temperature,
   fixed-position, request-hash, and no-fallback policy only after the simple
   mask validates.
2. Define the downstream RT-lnRNA candidate handoff accepted by
   `rt_lnrna_sponging_construct_triage`.

### Blockers

- No executable `thread` package exists.
- No sampling plan or backend-ingest contract is materialized.
- No sample table, candidate table, or backend result manifest exists.
- No fold-check runtime report with WT baseline, thresholds, and runtime
  parameter hash exists.
- No assembly feasibility report exists.
- No RT-only candidate handoff or RT-lnRNA acceptance record exists.

### Non-Goals

- Wet-lab protocol execution.
- Prime-editing campaign ownership.
- Replacing the RT-lnRNA sponging construct study.
- Hiding Eco1-specific biology inside a reusable tool package.
