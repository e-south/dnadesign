once you have clusters from umap mebeddings...


After performing Leiden clustering on your UMAP-reduced data, several analytical and visualization techniques can help you interpret and assess the clustering results, especially in relation to upstream groups associated with each point. Here are some common approaches:

Cluster Visualization:

UMAP Plot with Cluster Labels: Visualize the UMAP embedding with points colored according to their assigned Leiden clusters. This provides an intuitive view of the cluster separations and structures.
Overlay Upstream Group Information: Color or shape the points based on their upstream group associations to observe how these groups distribute across the identified clusters. This can reveal patterns or overlaps between clusters and upstream groups.
Cluster Composition Analysis:

Contingency Tables: Create tables that cross-tabulate clusters and upstream groups to quantify the representation of each group within clusters.
Bar Plots: Generate bar plots showing the proportion of upstream groups within each cluster, aiding in the assessment of cluster purity and diversity.
Diversity Assessment:

Shannon Entropy: Calculate the Shannon entropy for each cluster based on the distribution of upstream groups to measure diversity within clusters.
Simpson's Diversity Index: Compute this index to assess the probability that two randomly selected points within a cluster belong to different upstream groups.
Differential Feature Analysis:

Marker Identification: Identify features (e.g., genes in single-cell RNA sequencing data) that are differentially expressed in each cluster compared to others.
Heatmaps: Visualize the expression patterns of these marker features across clusters to understand the defining characteristics of each cluster.
Sub-clustering:

Refinement of Clusters: For large or heterogeneous clusters, perform sub-clustering to identify finer substructures or states within the data. This can uncover additional layers of organization that may be relevant to your analysis. 
SC BEST PRACTICES
Validation and Robustness Checks:

Cluster Stability: Assess the robustness of your clusters by varying parameters such as the number of neighbors in UMAP or the resolution in Leiden clustering.
Comparison with Other Methods: Compare your clustering results with those obtained from other clustering algorithms or dimensionality reduction techniques to ensure consistency.
Joint Visualization of Cells and Features:

biMAP: Use methods like CAbiNet to create joint visualizations of cells and genes, where both are embedded in the same space. This approach can help in identifying marker genes associated with specific clusters.

By employing these techniques, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your clustering results, evaluate the representation and diversity of upstream groups within clusters, and identify key features that define each cluster.
