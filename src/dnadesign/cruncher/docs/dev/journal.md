# cruncher dev journal

## 2026-02-04
- Start refactor to remove core I/O dependencies and progress UI from optimizers.
- Enforce strict no-fallback behaviors (numba cache location, auto-opt override).
- Split sample/analyze workflows into focused modules while keeping public entrypoints.
- Add core-import contract test and update docs to match strict behavior.
- Extracted sample workflow helpers into app/sample/* modules and slimmed app/sample_workflow to orchestration + re-exports.
- Split analysis helpers into app/analyze/* modules and kept app/analyze_workflow as the entrypoint.
- Reviewed cruncher docs (architecture, internals spec, sampling guide, config reference) for no-fallback alignment.
- Flagged explicit fallbacks (warm-start elites fallback, analyze partial outputs) as contradictions to "no fallbacks" goal.
- Proposed follow-ups: make warm-start strict, fail analyze on missing artifacts unless explicitly allowed, and migrate tests to new app submodules.
- Enforced warm-start to require sequences.parquet and removed elite fallbacks; missing seeds now error.
- Analyze now errors if trace.nc is missing when trace-based diagnostics are requested.
- Updated docs to reflect strict analyze artifacts and warm-start requirements.
- Reorganized tests into analysis/app/cli/core/ingest/store subfolders and fixed path-based tests.
- Profiled demo_basics_two_tf with a reduced budget; font-cache build dominated the first run, with scoring/pvalue setup next.
- Added analysis plan + manifest helpers to trim analyze_workflow and keep manifest writing cohesive.
- Made fetch CLI default its source from motif_store.source_preference and documented the requirement.
- Tightened auto-opt candidate validation: warn candidates now require allow_warn, and quality=fail is rejected.
- Added a core import contract test to keep core free of artifacts/cli/filesystem dependencies.
- Profiled `cruncher analyze --summary` (demo_basics_two_tf); runtime dominated by import overhead (~3s total).
- Audited demo_basics_two_tf outputs: auto_opt candidates=40 (20 specs x 2 budgets), 35 fail (ESS<10), 5 warn; winner selected via allow_warn. auto_opt outputs ~145M vs sample ~7.7M.
- Added learning metrics to analysis objective components + report (best score draw, plateau, early-stop simulation).
- Enforced early_stop.min_delta <= 0.1 for normalized-llr configs and added tests.
- Enabled early_stop and analysis.extra_tables in demo config; demo now emits auto_opt_pilots table.
- Updated docs (config, sampling guide, demo) to reflect learning metrics + early-stop guidance.
- Auto-opt quality grading now uses trace draw counts + ESS ratio; short pilots are marked warn and ESS ratio only warns (no hard-fail).
- Auto-opt candidate payload now records ess_ratio + trace_draws/expected to make pilot diagnostics scale-aware in auto_opt_pilots tables.
- Reran demo_basics_two_tf with full default config; auto-opt selected PT with warnings and produced sample run lexA-cpxR_20260204_140346_cb1935.
- Latest demo analysis warns only on low elite count (n_elites=1) and shows early-stop per-chain around draw 1500–1633.
- Auto-opt pilot summary: PT swap_prob=0.15 + aggressive/boosted cooling yields top top_k_median; ESS ratios remain very low (~0.001) across grid.
