## 2026-02-04
- Start refactor to remove core I/O dependencies and progress UI from optimizers.
- Enforce strict no-fallback behaviors (numba cache location, auto-opt override).
- Split sample/analyze workflows into focused modules while keeping public entrypoints.
- Add core-import contract test and update docs to match strict behavior.
- Extracted sample workflow helpers into app/sample/* modules and slimmed app/sample_workflow to orchestration + re-exports.
- Split analysis helpers into app/analyze/* modules and kept app/analyze_workflow as the entrypoint.
- Reviewed cruncher docs (architecture, internals spec, sampling guide, config reference) for no-fallback alignment.
- Flagged explicit fallbacks (warm-start elites fallback, analyze partial outputs) as contradictions to "no fallbacks" goal.
- Proposed follow-ups: make warm-start strict, fail analyze on missing artifacts unless explicitly allowed, and migrate tests to new app submodules.
- Enforced warm-start to require sequences.parquet and removed elite fallbacks; missing seeds now error.
- Analyze now errors if trace.nc is missing when trace-based diagnostics are requested.
- Updated docs to reflect strict analyze artifacts and warm-start requirements.
- Reorganized tests into analysis/app/cli/core/ingest/store subfolders and fixed path-based tests.
- Profiled demo_basics_two_tf with a reduced budget; font-cache build dominated the first run, with scoring/pvalue setup next.
- Added analysis plan + manifest helpers to trim analyze_workflow and keep manifest writing cohesive.
- Made fetch CLI default its source from motif_store.source_preference and documented the requirement.
- Tightened auto-opt candidate validation: warn candidates now require allow_warn, and quality=fail is rejected.
- Added a core import contract test to keep core free of artifacts/cli/filesystem dependencies.
- Profiled `cruncher analyze --summary` (demo_basics_two_tf); runtime dominated by import overhead (~3s total).
- Audited demo_basics_two_tf outputs: auto_opt candidates=40 (20 specs x 2 budgets), 35 fail (ESS<10), 5 warn; winner selected via allow_warn. auto_opt outputs ~145M vs sample ~7.7M.
- Added learning metrics to analysis objective components + report (best score draw, plateau, early-stop simulation).
- Enforced early_stop.min_delta <= 0.1 for normalized-llr configs and added tests.
- Enabled early_stop and analysis.extra_tables in demo config; demo now emits auto_opt_pilots table.
- Updated docs (config, sampling guide, demo) to reflect learning metrics + early-stop guidance.
- Auto-opt quality grading now uses trace draw counts + ESS ratio; short pilots are marked warn and ESS ratio only warns (no hard-fail).
- Auto-opt candidate payload now records ess_ratio + trace_draws/expected to make pilot diagnostics scale-aware in auto_opt_pilots tables.
- Reran demo_basics_two_tf with full default config; auto-opt selected PT with warnings and produced sample run lexA-cpxR_20260204_140346_cb1935.
- Latest demo analysis warns only on low elite count (n_elites=1) and shows early-stop per-chain around draw 1500-1633.
- Auto-opt pilot summary: PT swap_prob=0.15 + aggressive/boosted cooling yields top top_k_median; ESS ratios remain very low (~0.001) across grid.
- Added `min_norm` to sequences.parquet for fast per-draw consensus filtering.
- Lowered demo `min_per_tf_norm` / `success_min_per_tf_norm` to 0.60 after inspecting draw percentiles (median ~0.28, 95th ~0.55) and unique counts.
- Updated CLI docs to describe the MMR scorecard as the default auto-opt selector.
- Allow NUMBA_CACHE_DIR overrides when an explicit cache_dir is provided (warn + overwrite) to keep CLI runs deterministic in workspaces.
- Reordered MMR selection to run after final candidate pool assembly so final elites preserve diversity (MMR meta now matches elites).
- Reran demo_basics_two_tf after the MMR ordering change: latest run lexA-cpxR_20260204_174159_fdeee2 produced 10 elites with 10 unique canonical sequences and unique_successes=24.
- Design Section 4 plan of action: (1) audit + prune config schema to essential knobs (enforce init.length >= max PWM width; canonicalize MMR when bidirectional), (2) behavior cleanup (PT-only, no auto-disable paths), (3) refactor cohesion (split auto_opt and run_set by responsibility), (4) tests (CLI smoke test, fixed-length vs max PWM), (5) docs alignment (sampling/config docs; MMR TFBS-core behavior), (6) performance sanity (note scorer DP caching; no core kernel changes now).

## 2026-02-05
- Brainstorming: Intent + Plan of Action (200-300 words). Cruncher's intent is to generate short, fixed-length DNA sequences that jointly satisfy multiple PWMs while returning a diverse elite set, with diversity defined across sequences rather than within a sequence's motif windows. The MCMC kernel should remain unchanged; selection, scoring, and stopping should be assertive and predictable. The hard-break simplification focuses on keeping only essential knobs so users can reason about outcomes with minimal configuration. Plan of action: first, prune config schema to essential knobs and enforce sample.init.length >= max PWM width with canonical MMR under bidirectional scoring. Second, behavior cleanup removes auto-disable or warm-start paths and keeps the optimizer PT-only. Third, improve cohesion by splitting app/sample/auto_opt.py into candidate generation, scoring/selection, and orchestration, and splitting app/sample/run_set.py into run layout, candidate pool creation, MMR selection/metadata, and manifest writing. Fourth, add tests that assert fixed-length constraints and include a CLI smoke test using the two-TF demo. Fifth, align docs (sampling + config) to state fixed length, TFBS-core MMR behavior, and canonicalization under bidirectional scoring. Sixth, add lightweight profiling to identify hot paths, with an eye toward reusing scorer caches across pilots without touching the kernel.
- Fixed a recursion bug in `_assert_init_length_fits_pwms` and centralized the max-PWM length check.
- Removed warm-start seed injection in PT; chains now always start from a shared seed plus small perturbations.
- Dropped `dsdna_hamming` from analysis metadata; diversity metrics now follow `dsdna_canonicalize`.
- Removed unused MMR sequence-distance export and updated tests to align with the slimmer API.
- Reworked the sequence-normalization test to assert the helper is absent.
- Added a minimal CLI smoke test that runs a two-TF matrix sample with tiny budgets.
- Tightened analysis fixtures to include explicit MMR selection policy and fixed demo config indentation.
- Added `min_per_tf_norm` to sequences.parquet and asserted it in the CLI smoke test.
- Gated early-stop reporting on unique-success requirements and surfaced a diagnostics warning when unique_successes < min_unique.
- Lowered demo `min_per_tf_norm` / `success_min_per_tf_norm` to 0.40 and reran demo_basics_two_tf; elites now populate (n=10) and early-stop triggers cleanly.
- Ran the demo end-to-end (fetch motifs/sites -> lock -> parse -> sample -> analyze) using the workspace config.
- Profiled `cruncher sample` on demo_basics_two_tf; dominant cost is PWM log-odds -> p-value lookup construction (`core/pvalue.py`), with scorer init next (candidate for cross-pilot cache reuse).
- Updated docs (demo, sampling guide, config reference, architecture) to reflect PT-only language, TFBS-core MMR behavior, and sequences column naming.
- Removed sample.budget.restarts from schema/config/code to eliminate PT-only fallback overrides; updated tests, docs, and demo configs accordingly.
- Added an in-memory LRU cache for PWM log-odds -> p-value lookup tables (core/pvalue.py) to reuse DP results across auto-opt pilots; added a minimal cache-hit test.
- Added audit design doc for Cruncher end-to-end review (docs/plans/2026-02-05-cruncher-audit-design.md), emphasizing PT-only, fixed-length invariants, MMR canonical selection, and doc/workspace alignment over test bloat.
- Recorded p-value cache hit/miss stats in run manifests and surfaced them in diagnostics metrics for transparency.
- Hardened bidirectional logp correction (counts both strands) and codified deterministic best-hit tie-breaking.
- Added atomic artifact writes (status/manifest/config, parquet, analysis summaries) and retry-on-read for run status with clear CLI errors.
- Persisted effective PT ladder details in elites metadata and added tests for p-seq math, tie-breaking, atomic writes, and PT stats.
- Added Contents TOCs across docs and aligned demo/reference text with current fixed-length PT behavior.
- Ran cruncher tests and the two-TF demo flow (fetch -> lock -> parse -> sample -> analyze); removed an ArviZ warning by increasing draws in the regulator set test and clarified dashboard-only plot outputs in the sampling guide.
- Removed auto-opt scorecard `k` as a config knob; auto-opt now derives the scorecard size from `elites.k` and fails fast if `elites.k < 1` when optimizer is auto.
- Raised default auto-opt pilot budgets to 2000/3000 and aligned the multi-TF demo workspace to match.
- Added auto-opt confidence highlights to analysis reports and CLI summaries so pilots are easier to interpret at a glance.
- Updated sampling/CLI/demo docs to state `elites.k` drives the scorecard size and to guide pilots when elites fall short.
- Added a v3 single-path schema design: `sequence_length`, `compute.total_sweeps`, and `compute.adapt_sweep_frac` with explicit numeric elite gates (`min_per_tf_norm`, `mmr_alpha`), removing pilot grids and inference-style tune/draws.
- Removed auto-opt orchestration modules and CLI/report wiring; updated demos/workspaces and sampling docs to the fixed-length compute schema with no pilot references.

## 2026-02-06
- Continued v3 work: updated schema_v3 to be self-contained (removed schema_v2 imports) and aligned CLI config/analyze commands with the v3 surface.
- Simplified analysis CLI to v3 behavior (run selection + summary only) and removed plot/tf-pair override flags.
- Updated v3 docs (config reference, sampling/analysis guide, demos, ingestion/meme suite guides, architecture, internals spec) to match the curated analysis suite and v3 schema terminology.
- Added a local encode helper in analysis/per_pwm to remove dependency on deprecated scatter utils.
- Added baseline hits artifacts for analysis-only plots and updated sampling to emit `random_baseline_hits.parquet`.
- Replaced the run dashboard + diagnostics plots with a curated v3 plot suite: run summary + trajectory + NN distance + overlap panel + health panel.
- Updated analysis workflow and plot registry to use baseline NN references, new plot names, and health-only diagnostics.
- Simplified overlap plotting to a single panel figure with best-hit labels and readability rules.
- Updated analysis tests and docs to match the new plot suite and baseline artifacts.
- Added an intent + lifecycle guide and linked it from docs index, demo, config, and architecture references.

## 2026-02-11
- Refactored the analysis plot suite to improve optimizer narrative and diagnostics while preserving existing output filenames.
- Added shared plot styling utilities (`analysis/plots/_style.py`) and applied them across trajectory, diversity, overlap, and health plots.
- Upgraded trajectory scatter to show best-so-far lineage updates with selected elite overlays and objective-caption footnotes.
- Upgraded trajectory sweep to explicit joint-score labeling and optional tune/cooling boundary markers.
- Replaced elite NN histogram output with a two-panel diversity view (score vs full-sequence NN distance + full-sequence pairwise distance matrix), while retaining motif-core distance context.
- Replaced health panel with MH-only acceptance dynamics plus move-mix over sweeps; excluded Gibbs `S` moves from acceptance semantics.
- Replaced overlap panel with placement-first motif tracks, pairwise placement scatter, and overlap summary subpanel.
- Hardened MMR distance contracts (`compute_core_distance` bounded in [0,1]) and added deterministic tie-break behavior using full-sequence distance when core distances tie.
- Updated plot registry descriptions and docs (`sampling_and_analysis.md`, `reference/config.md`) to match the new plot semantics and UX narrative.
- Validated with full Cruncher analysis test suite and demo workspace CLI analyze runs.
- Ran a cold-tail Gibbs sweep across all three demo workspaces (`baseline` vs `cold_tail`) and selected `cold_tail` for each based on combined quality/diversity/stability metrics.
- Promoted winning defaults into canonical demo configs: earlier adaptation freeze (`freeze_after_beta=6`), higher Gibbs inertia (`p_stay_end=0.85`), lower tail `S` move share, and colder final piecewise cooling stages.
- Verified updated canonical demos end-to-end (`lock -> parse -> sample -> analyze`) and recorded improved tail diagnostics (notably reduced rugged downhill acceptance and Gibbs tail flip rate) while maintaining 8 elites and high per-TF scores.
- Ran a focused elite-selection alpha sweep on campaign+densegen at fixed cold-tail kernels; campaign results were alpha-invariant on selected metrics, while densegen showed a quality/diversity tradeoff and settled on `alpha=0.70` as the default balance point.
- Ran a two-TF alpha spot-check (`0.55` vs `0.85`) and observed identical elite set/metrics under fixed seed+kernel, so the existing `alpha=0.85` remains unchanged there.
- Fixed analyze crash in overlap plotting by replacing unsupported colormap `mako` with matplotlib-native `viridis`.
- Updated the elite diversity panel to show full-sequence Hamming distances in base pairs (bp) on both the score-vs-diversity axis and distance-matrix colorbar, so effective elite diversity is directly interpretable without normalization.
- Revalidated `demo_basics_two_tf` canonical outputs after rerun: elites remain `8/8` unique sequences, with full-sequence pairwise Hamming distance `min/median/max = 1/13/14 bp` (sequence length 16 bp), confirming no exact duplicates while exposing remaining near-duplicate tails.
- Clarified optimizer score semantics in plots: sweep y-axis now labels optimizer scalar meaning explicitly (`min` vs `sum`, soft-min on/off, and score scale), and elite diversity y-axis labels final optimizer scalar source.
- Hardened elite score fallback reconstruction to respect objective combine mode (`sum` no longer falls back to `min`), with regression coverage in `test_nn_distance_identity`.
- Tightened score-axis wording to reduce label verbosity while preserving semantics; y-labels now use compact forms like `Opt scalar (...)` and `Replay objective (...)` with explicit combine/scale context.
- Investigated why selected elites appeared as a single point in `plot__chain_trajectory_scatter`: confirmed this was not duplicate-sequence selection; elites were unique in primary sequence but had identical per-TF best-window scores, yielding identical scatter coordinates.
- Confirmed core-space collapse for the two-TF demo (`core_lexA/core_cpxR` identical across elites) with non-zero full-sequence diversity, so MMR tie-breaks were operating on full-sequence distance under score ties.
- Hardened trajectory scatter UX by aggregating overlapping elite coordinates, scaling marker size by multiplicity, and annotating stacked points with `×N` counts.
- Added scatter metadata fields `elite_unique_coordinates` and `elite_coordinate_collisions` for explicit diagnostics and regression testing.
- Added a fail-fast uniqueness validation in sampling (`run_set.py`) to raise if duplicate elite sequence keys survive selection/output assembly.
- Refined `plot__chain_trajectory_scatter` elite rendering for coordinate-collision cases: colliding elites now render as separate markers arranged around the true score coordinate with faint spokes, preventing single-marker information collapse while preserving score-space semantics.
- Added scatter metadata field `elite_rendered_points` and regression coverage in `test_opt_trajectory_plot.py` to ensure each elite is visually represented even when coordinates collide.
- Added a diversity-first elite selection surface under `sample.elites.select` with macro knob `diversity` (`0..1`) plus advanced constrained-MMR controls (`distance_metric`, `min_hamming_bp`, `min_core_hamming_bp`, `constraint_policy`, `relax_step_bp`, `relax_min_bp`, `pool_strategy`).
- Implemented constrained MMR in `core/selection/mmr.py` with deterministic hard-distance feasibility checks, strict/relax policies, hybrid/full/core distance modes, and persisted threshold outcomes (`*_requested`, `*_final`, `relax_steps_used`).
- Added deterministic full-sequence/core tie handling and expanded MMR metadata (`nearest_distance_core`, `nearest_distance_core_bp`) for better auditability.
- Added stratified candidate-pool construction across `(chain, cooling_stage)` plus geometric pool expansion in `app/sample/elites_mmr.py` when diversity-constrained selection cannot initially fill `k`.
- Wired effective selection parameters into sample metadata (`mmr_alpha`, `mmr_alpha_user`, `mmr_diversity`, `pool_strategy`, constraint finals), so analysis/reporting reflects actual optimization-time selection behavior.
- Extended `analysis.mmr_sweep` with diversity-aware replay (`diversity_values`, `distance_metric`, `constraint_policy`) and new table outputs (`alpha_eff`, requested/final constraints, relax steps, selection_error).
- Fixed `analysis.mmr_sweep` core replay failure when PWM width exceeds sequence length by clipping replay core width to sequence length in `tfbs_cores_from_scorer`; added regression coverage.
- Updated demo workspace configs to use the diversity macro (`sample.elites.select.diversity`) and updated reference/sampling docs plus optimizer-surface tests to match.
- Audited `schema_v3` surface against runtime usage and removed-key regression tests: no new stale/no-op keys found in active Cruncher v3 paths; existing removed keys remain enforced by `tests/config/test_removed_config_keys.py`.
- Fixed `analysis.mmr_sweep` parquet serialization failure when `pool_size_input` mixes `'auto'` and integers by normalizing `pool_size_input` to string before table write; added regression test `test_run_mmr_sweep_table_is_parquet_writable_with_mixed_pool_size_inputs`.
- Generated demo variant matrix (`score_focus`, `balanced`, `diversity_focus`, `strict_probe`) for `demo_basics_two_tf`, `demo_campaigns_multi_tf`, and `densegen_prep_three_tf` under `workspaces/*/variants/`.
- Ran bounded offline MMR diversity sweeps (`alpha=0.85`, `pool_size in {auto,1600,4000}`, `diversity in {0,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.9}`) for all three demos and updated balanced variants with measured settings:
  - `two_tf`: balanced -> `diversity=0.25` (higher values relaxed to zero constraints with no added full-sequence separation).
  - `campaign`: balanced -> `diversity=0.5`, `pool_size=4000` (non-zero diversity pressure with strong score retention).
  - `densegen`: balanced -> `diversity=0.5` (large gain in minimum pairwise full-sequence distance with small score drop).
- Culled stale elite schema surface: removed `sample.elites.filter` and advanced `sample.elites.select.*` controls (`alpha`, `relevance`, distance/constraint/pool-strategy knobs) so the user-facing knobs are now only `k`, `select.diversity`, and `select.pool_size`.
- Removed pre-MMR threshold gating in sampling (`_elite_filter_passes` path), so MMR now always operates directly on the candidate draw pool.
- Added explicit pool-size resolver policy with `pool_size: auto|all|int`, where `auto = min(candidate_count, min(20000, max(4000, 500*k)))`.
- Updated analysis sweep defaults to diversity/pool-size grids, with fixed internal MMR relevance (`min_tf_score`) and fixed base alpha (`0.85`) to reduce config cognitive load.
- Updated canonical demos and generated variant configs to the cleaned schema; removed temporary `_mmr_sweep_tmp` configs that still referenced removed keys.
- Added/updated schema and runtime tests (including new `test_elite_pool_policy.py`) and revalidated with full Cruncher test suite + Ruff check/format.
- Aligned offline `analysis.mmr_sweep` with sampling-time MMR distance semantics (`hybrid` at `diversity=0` as well), eliminating the analysis/runtime mismatch.
- Renamed tail acceptance summary/report surface from ambiguous `acceptance_rate_mh_tail` to explicit `acceptance_rate_non_s_tail`.
- Removed residual threading of removed catalog PWM-window config keys by deleting `CatalogConfig` compatibility properties and dropping those no-op args from parse/sample/campaign/catalog store construction paths.
- Ran a direct two-TF sampling sweep over `sample.elites.select.diversity` using real `sample` outputs (not replay-only sweep) and measured score/diversity tradeoff from each run's `optimize/elites.parquet`.
- Two-TF score vs diversity table (full-sequence Hamming in bp): `0.00 -> median_score 0.7122, median_nn 1.0, min_pairwise 1.0`; `0.05 -> 0.6749, 5.5, 3.0`; `0.10 -> 0.6540, 5.5, 4.0`; `0.15 -> 0.6426, 6.5, 5.0`; `0.20 -> 0.6366, 6.0, 4.0`; `0.25 -> 0.6306, 7.0, 6.0`; `0.35 -> 0.5949, 7.0, 5.0`; `0.40 -> 0.5929, 7.0, 5.0`; `0.60 -> 0.5563, 8.0, 5.0`; `0.80 -> 0.5069, 8.0, 6.0`; `1.00 -> 0.2785, 7.5, 7.0`.
- Interpretation: `diversity=0.00` now correctly maps to score-only selection and collapses (`NN=1 bp`). Practical knee for two-TF is `0.10..0.25`; chose `0.15` as score-favoring default with non-collapsed elites.
- Plot candidate to add in analysis: `plot__elites_diversity_tradeoff_curve` from `analysis.mmr_sweep` table, with x=`diversity`, left y=`median_score_selected`, right y=`median_nn_full_bp` and `min_pairwise_full_bp`, plus a marked knee/default point. This would make default selection evidence visible from a single run artifact.
