## 2026-02-04
- Start refactor to remove core I/O dependencies and progress UI from optimizers.
- Enforce strict no-fallback behaviors (numba cache location, auto-opt override).
- Split sample/analyze workflows into focused modules while keeping public entrypoints.
- Add core-import contract test and update docs to match strict behavior.
- Extracted sample workflow helpers into app/sample/* modules and slimmed app/sample_workflow to orchestration + re-exports.
- Split analysis helpers into app/analyze/* modules and kept app/analyze_workflow as the entrypoint.
- Reviewed cruncher docs (architecture, internals spec, sampling guide, config reference) for no-fallback alignment.
- Flagged explicit fallbacks (warm-start elites fallback, analyze partial outputs) as contradictions to "no fallbacks" goal.
- Proposed follow-ups: make warm-start strict, fail analyze on missing artifacts unless explicitly allowed, and migrate tests to new app submodules.
- Enforced warm-start to require sequences.parquet and removed elite fallbacks; missing seeds now error.
- Analyze now errors if trace.nc is missing when trace-based diagnostics are requested.
- Updated docs to reflect strict analyze artifacts and warm-start requirements.
- Reorganized tests into analysis/app/cli/core/ingest/store subfolders and fixed path-based tests.
- Profiled demo_basics_two_tf with a reduced budget; font-cache build dominated the first run, with scoring/pvalue setup next.
- Added analysis plan + manifest helpers to trim analyze_workflow and keep manifest writing cohesive.
- Made fetch CLI default its source from motif_store.source_preference and documented the requirement.
- Tightened auto-opt candidate validation: warn candidates now require allow_warn, and quality=fail is rejected.
- Added a core import contract test to keep core free of artifacts/cli/filesystem dependencies.
- Profiled `cruncher analyze --summary` (demo_basics_two_tf); runtime dominated by import overhead (~3s total).
- Audited demo_basics_two_tf outputs: auto_opt candidates=40 (20 specs x 2 budgets), 35 fail (ESS<10), 5 warn; winner selected via allow_warn. auto_opt outputs ~145M vs sample ~7.7M.
- Added learning metrics to analysis objective components + report (best score draw, plateau, early-stop simulation).
- Enforced early_stop.min_delta <= 0.1 for normalized-llr configs and added tests.
- Enabled early_stop and analysis.extra_tables in demo config; demo now emits auto_opt_pilots table.
- Updated docs (config, sampling guide, demo) to reflect learning metrics + early-stop guidance.
- Auto-opt quality grading now uses trace draw counts + ESS ratio; short pilots are marked warn and ESS ratio only warns (no hard-fail).
- Auto-opt candidate payload now records ess_ratio + trace_draws/expected to make pilot diagnostics scale-aware in auto_opt_pilots tables.
- Reran demo_basics_two_tf with full default config; auto-opt selected PT with warnings and produced sample run lexA-cpxR_20260204_140346_cb1935.
- Latest demo analysis warns only on low elite count (n_elites=1) and shows early-stop per-chain around draw 1500–1633.
- Auto-opt pilot summary: PT swap_prob=0.15 + aggressive/boosted cooling yields top top_k_median; ESS ratios remain very low (~0.001) across grid.
- Added `min_norm` to sequences.parquet for fast per-draw consensus filtering.
- Lowered demo `min_per_tf_norm` / `success_min_per_tf_norm` to 0.60 after inspecting draw percentiles (median ~0.28, 95th ~0.55) and unique counts.
- Updated CLI docs to describe the MMR scorecard as the default auto-opt selector.
- Allow NUMBA_CACHE_DIR overrides when an explicit cache_dir is provided (warn + overwrite) to keep CLI runs deterministic in workspaces.
- Reordered MMR selection to run after polish/trim on the candidate pool so final elites preserve diversity (MMR meta now matches elites).
- Reran demo_basics_two_tf after the MMR polish change: latest run lexA-cpxR_20260204_174159_fdeee2 produced 10 elites with 10 unique canonical sequences and unique_successes=24.
- Design Section 4 plan of action: (1) audit + prune config schema (remove trim/polish, auto_opt.length, min_hamming, dsDNA_hamming, selection.distance.*, relevance_norm; enforce init.length >= max PWM width; canonicalize MMR when bidirectional), (2) behavior cleanup (PT-only; remove trim/polish/warm-start paths, no auto-disable), (3) refactor cohesion (split auto_opt and run_set by responsibility), (4) tests (reject removed keys, CLI smoke test, fixed-length vs max PWM), (5) docs alignment (sampling/config docs; MMR TFBS-core behavior), (6) performance sanity (note scorer DP caching; no core kernel changes now).

- Brainstorming: Intent + Plan of Action (200-300 words). Cruncher's intent is to generate short, fixed-length DNA sequences that jointly satisfy multiple PWMs while returning a diverse elite set, with diversity defined across sequences rather than within a sequence's motif windows. The MCMC kernel should remain unchanged; selection, scoring, and stopping should be assertive and predictable. The hard-break simplification focuses on removing soft knobs and hidden fallbacks so users can reason about outcomes with minimal configuration. Plan of action: first, prune config schema to remove non-essential knobs: trim/polish, all auto_opt.length.*, legacy elite diversity toggles, and distance/normalization variants. Canonicalization becomes a deterministic consequence of objective.bidirectional. Enforce sample.init.length >= max PWM width at runtime and document this as a hard invariant. Second, behavior cleanup removes any residual "auto-disable" or warm-start paths and locks the optimizer to PT only. Third, improve cohesion by splitting app/sample/auto_opt.py into candidate generation, scoring/selection, and orchestration, and splitting app/sample/run_set.py into run layout, candidate pool creation, MMR selection/metadata, and manifest writing. Fourth, add tests that reject removed keys, assert fixed-length constraints, and include a CLI smoke test using the two-TF demo. Fifth, align docs (sampling + config) to state: fixed length is explicit, MMR is TFBS-core across sequences, and canonicalization is automatic with bidirectional scoring. Sixth, add lightweight profiling to identify hot paths, with an eye toward reusing scorer caches across pilots without touching the kernel.
- Fixed a recursion bug in `_assert_init_length_fits_pwms` and centralized the max-PWM length check.
- Removed warm-start seed injection in PT; chains now always start from a shared seed plus small perturbations.
- Dropped `dsdna_hamming` from analysis metadata; diversity metrics now follow `dsdna_canonicalize`.
- Removed unused MMR sequence-distance export and updated tests to align with the slimmer API.
- Reworked the polish test to assert the helper is removed (no trim/polish fallback).
- Added a minimal CLI smoke test that runs a two-TF matrix sample with tiny budgets.
- Tightened analysis fixtures to include explicit MMR selection policy and fixed demo config indentation.
- Added `min_per_tf_norm` to sequences.parquet and asserted it in the CLI smoke test.
- Gated early-stop reporting on unique-success requirements and surfaced a diagnostics warning when unique_successes < min_unique.
- Lowered demo `min_per_tf_norm` / `success_min_per_tf_norm` to 0.40 and reran demo_basics_two_tf; elites now populate (n=10) and early-stop triggers cleanly.
- Ran the demo end-to-end (fetch motifs/sites → lock → parse → sample → analyze) using the workspace config.
- Profiled `cruncher sample` on demo_basics_two_tf; dominant cost is PWM log-odds → p-value lookup construction (`core/pvalue.py`), with scorer init next (candidate for cross-pilot cache reuse).
- Updated docs (demo, sampling guide, config reference, architecture) to reflect PT-only language, TFBS-core MMR behavior, and sequences column naming.
- Removed sample.budget.restarts from schema/config/code to eliminate PT-only fallback overrides; updated tests, docs, and demo configs accordingly.
- Added audit design doc for Cruncher end-to-end review (docs/plans/2026-02-05-cruncher-audit-design.md), emphasizing PT-only, fixed-length invariants, MMR canonical selection, and doc/workspace alignment over test bloat.
