# Cruncher docs map

Start here if you are new to Cruncher:

- `demo.md` — end-to-end walkthrough (RegulonDB LexA + CpxR).
- `cli.md` — concise command reference and examples.
- `config.md` — configuration schema with annotated examples.

Find info by goal (quick lookup):

- **“What can I do right now?”** → `cli.md` (commands + examples).
- **“How do I run the full pipeline?”** → `demo.md`.
- **“How do I set config options?”** → `config.md`.
- **“What is stored where?”** → `architecture.md`.
- **“Why did a fetch/hydration fail?”** → `troubleshooting.md`.
- **“How does ingestion work?”** → `ingestion.md`.

When you need deeper context:

- `architecture.md` — component boundaries and run artifacts.
- `ingestion.md` — source adapters, caching, hydration, and QA.
- `troubleshooting.md` — common errors and fixes.
- `spec.md` — full requirements and design rationale.
