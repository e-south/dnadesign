How Scorer + SequenceEvaluator Fit Into the Gibbs Sampler
	1.	SequenceState ‚ûî Scoring
The optimizer maintains a candidate sequence as a SequenceState (an integer‚Äêencoded DNA string). At each MCMC step, it proposes a small change (e.g. flipping one base, replacing a block, or flipping multiple sites).
	2.	Evaluator as a Simple Adapter
Rather than calling Scorer directly, the optimizer always invokes evaluator(state). Internally, the SequenceEvaluator does two things:
	‚Ä¢	It asks Scorer for each PWM‚Äôs best log-odds (LLR) score on that sequence.
	‚Ä¢	It converts those per-PWM LLRs into one unified ‚Äúfitness‚Äù number (by applying the chosen scale‚Äîe.g. ‚Äúlog-p‚Äù or ‚Äúz‚Äù or ‚Äúraw LLR‚Äù‚Äîand then taking the minimum across all PWMs).
	3.	Scorer‚Äôs Responsibilities
	‚Ä¢	Per-PWM null distributions are built once at startup: for each PWM, we precompute a grid of possible LLR sums (lom) and the exact tail‚Äêprobabilities (p-values).
	‚Ä¢	When asked to score a sequence, Scorer scans every possible window (forward and reverse complement) for each PWM, finds the single highest LLR, and‚Äîif needed‚Äîturns it into a p-value or z-score or normalized ‚Äúlog-p.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	The result is that each PWM ends up with one number (e.g. ‚Äú‚àílog‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(p_seq)‚Äù or ‚Äúz-score‚Äù) for the current sequence.
	4.	Reduction to a Single Fitness
Once every PWM has its own scaled score, the SequenceEvaluator simply takes the minimum of those numbers. The Gibbs sampler treats that minimum as its target fitness (higher = better). In other words, optimizing means ‚Äúraise the worst PWM match‚Äù until all PWMs appear strongly anywhere in the sequence.
	5.	Optimizer Logic (in cgm.py)
	‚Ä¢	The Gibbs loop proposes a move ‚Üí calls fitness_old = evaluator(old_state) ‚Üí applies the change ‚Üí calls fitness_new = evaluator(new_state) ‚Üí accepts or rejects based on the Metropolis rule at the current inverse temperature (Œ≤).
	‚Ä¢	Because SequenceEvaluator hides all the per-PWM bookkeeping, the optimizer code never needs to know about null distributions, p-values, or even how many PWMs exist. It just asks ‚ÄúWhat is the fitness of this sequence?‚Äù and uses that to guide acceptance.

By cleanly separating ‚Äúhow to turn a DNA string into a single number‚Äù (Scorer + Evaluator) from ‚Äúhow to propose and accept/reject moves‚Äù (GibbsOptimizer), we keep each component focused, easy to read, and modular.


The score is 0 if the sequence has the same probability of being a functional site and of being a random site. The score is greater than 0 if it is more likely to be a functional site than a random site, and less than 0 if it is more likely to be a random site than a functional site.[1] The sequence score can also be interpreted in a physical framework as the binding energy for that sequence.

The p-value already tells you ‚Äúhow surprising is the best window of this PWM in this sequence compared with random DNA of the same length?‚Äù  


A more informative axis: ‚Äúconsensus-normalised logp‚Äù
Below is an easy drop-in normalisation that preserves all the good properties of the FIMO p-value but spreads the dynamic range uniformly between 0 and 1:

p_consensus‚ÄÉ= Bonferroni-corrected p-value of the PWM‚Äôs own consensus embedded in the same L-bp background

interpretation	value
sequence has no convincing hit	0
sequence‚Äôs best hit is as good as the consensus	1
halfway in log-space between random and consensus	0.5

Because both numerator and denominator are bona-fide FIMO p-values, the ratio stays monotonic in the raw evidence. You keep the nice cross-PWM comparability and you never suffer the ‚Äúall zeros‚Äù collapse.
	‚Ä¢	Keep using p-values ‚Äì they are the right way to compare heterogeneous PWMs.
	‚Ä¢	Normalise them by the PWM‚Äôs own consensus strength to map everything into 0, 1.
	‚Ä¢	Update the config to scorer_scale: logp_norm; the plot will immediately give you an intuitive ‚Äúfraction-of-perfect‚Äù picture for every sequence in every chain.


**cruncher** is a pipeline that automates the design of short DNA sequences embedding strong matches for all user-supplied transcription-factor PWMs:

1. **Parse**
   Read one or many PWMs (MEME, JASPAR, ‚Ä¶) and generate sequence‚Äêlogo plots.

2. **Sample**
   Initialize a random DNA sequence and run a **simulated-annealing MCMC** optimizer to discover sequences whose best motif‚Äêmatch p-values are jointly maximized.

3. **Analyze**
   Reload any past batch, regenerate plots (score distributions, PWM scatter, logo overlays) without re-sampling.

> "Generate short DNA sequences that contain strong matches for all user-supplied TF PWMs, possibly highly overlapping on either strand."

#### Core Concept

> ‚ÄúIf I draw uniform random DNA of this length, what is the chance I‚Äôd see a window scoring ‚â• my best motif alignment?‚Äù

That tail p-value is exactly what FIMO reports per hit.  We implement it in-house via:

1. **Log-odds scan**
   L<sub>i,b</sub> = log‚ÇÇ(p<sub>i,b</sub>/0.25)
   s = ‚àë‚ÇÅ·µÇ L<sub>i, x<sub>i</sub></sub>
   (sliding both strands via a Numba inner loop)

2. **Exact null distribution (DP)**

   * Scale L to integers (0.001-bit resolution)
   * Convolve column-wise over bases (iid 0.25 each) ‚Üí P(score = k)
   * Compute tail P(S ‚â• k) once per PWM ‚Üí `(scores[], tail_p[])` lookup

3. **Fitness**
   For sequence x,
   p<sub>i</sub> = tail\_p<sub>i</sub>(max s<sub>i</sub>)
   **fitness(x) = ‚àílog‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(min<sub>i</sub> p<sub>i</sub>)**

Maximizing this ensures **all** TF motifs match significantly, on either strand, fairly across varying motif lengths/content.

#### Optimization Logic

We perform a **temperature-controlled Gibbs/Metropolis mixture** (simulated annealing):

| Phase       | Œ≤ (‚Äúinverse temperature‚Äù) | Moves            | Goal                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Explore** | 0 ‚Üí 0.1                   | B-locks, M-multi | Traverse basins, avoid traps |
| **Refine**  | 0.1 ‚Üí 1.0                 | S/B/M blend      | Focus on genuine peaks       |
| **Freeze**  | ‚â• 1.0 (up to 2‚Äì3)         | S-single flips   | Polish top hits              |

Œ≤ follows your config (`sample.optimiser.gibbs.cooling`): either **fixed** or **piece-wise linear**.

#### Move Catalogue

| Code    | Type                           | Step size                          | Intuition                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **S**   | Single‚Äênucleotide Gibbs flip   | 1 bp                               | Fine-tune; very high accept |
| **B**   | Contiguous block replacement   | random length ‚àà `[min,max]` bp     | Cross shallow minima        |
| **M**   | K disjoint flips (multi‚ÄêGibbs) | K ‚àà `[kmin,kmax]`, scattered sites | Mix distant regions         |
| (SL/SW) | Slide / Swap windows (MH)      | reserved for future enhancement    | ‚Äî                           |

Move probabilities adapt with Œ≤ (see `_sample_move_kind()`), shifting weight from **coarse** (B/M) to **precise** (S) as temperature cools.

#### One Sweep

1. **Determine Œ≤** from schedule.
2. **Select move** type by Œ≤-dependent weights.
3. **Propose** a fragment change.
4. **Accept** with probability ‚àù exp(Œ≤¬∑Œîfitness) (Gibbs or Metropolis).
5. **Record** diagnostics; after burn-in, save each full sequence as a draw.
