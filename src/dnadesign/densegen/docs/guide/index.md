### What this guide covers

The guide focuses on how to supply inputs, define constraints, interpret outputs, and keep runs
reproducible. It does not list every config key; use the reference for the full schema.

1) Inputs and libraries: `inputs.md`
2) Planning and constraints: `generation.md`
3) Outputs and metadata: `outputs-metadata.md`
4) Gap fill behavior: `postprocess.md`
5) Run layout and ergonomics: `workspace.md`
